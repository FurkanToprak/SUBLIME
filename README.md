# lime-rs-code
A rewrite of coionobrega's [explaining-recommendations](https://github.com/caionobrega/explaining-recommendations) repository, which is an implementation of LIME-RS, as discussed in [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3297280.3297443).

## Disclaimer
I am not the author of the novel LIME algorithm or the implementation for Recommender Systems (LIME-RS). I merely wrote this to use in my own research, as the original codebase was not useable. 

## Instructions
### Installing Dependencies
Run `pipenv install`.
## Running Code
1) Run environment `pipenv shell`. Can be deactivated with `exit`.
2)
